A collection of networks services, protocols, and architectures.

## Token Ring network

Token ring is a network topology tailored to achieve low latency and
real time networking at the cost of some reliability.

Written in pure ANSI C.

## Hi-ADSD network architecture

A hierarchical adaptive distributed system-level diagnosis algorithm.

Consists of a (log N)^2-time strategy to diagnose a faulty or fault-free
network of N nodes.

This incredibly low complexity time is achieved by using the fact that
diagnosis tasks can be run asynchronously.

Written in pure ANSI C at UFPR Computer Science labs by Dr Elias Duarte.

## Hypercube mapping

It maps nodes numbers to their positions in a hypercube vector space.

A closure in this network using these keys grants messages to be delivered
in O(log N) worst-case messages exchanges.

## Remote Procedure Call

A server-client architecture wherein a client passes along a formula to
a string of machines until reaching the remote server which will evaluate
and return its result.

Network can handle as many layer nodes as wanted between client and server.

Written in pure ANSI C.

## FTP server-client

Written in C++ using *raw sockets*, messages are passed through bare wire
in direct connections by the use of a crossover cable.

It works hierarchicaly below IP protocol mimicking TCP/IP functionalities
like parity-checking, sliding windows, package splitting, error correction,
interruption resilience, among others.
